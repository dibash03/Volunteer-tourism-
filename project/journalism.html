        <h2>WHAT IS JOURNALISM ?</h2><br>
		<p>Journalism is the practice of gathering, assessing, creating, and presenting news and information to the public. It involves reporting on current events, issues, and trends through various media channels, such as newspapers, television, radio, and online platforms. The goal of journalism is to inform, educate, and engage the public by providing accurate, timely, and relevant information.</p><br><br><br>
			<h2>JOURNALISM IN NEPAL</h2><br>
			<p>Journalism in Nepal has transformed vastly in recent years, both in terms of the number of media outlets and media practitioners. Public access to media is also developing at a stunning rate. Printing houses and media channels continue to grow. FM radio stations are broadcasting from numerous villages. While this measurable development continues, focus has now moved to the requests for quality and reliability of information. More than half of the Nepali journalists are between 19 and 30 years of age with women as a minority in number.
                Over 40% of the journalists reported their dissatisfaction with achievement in the profession. Nepal still needs to focus on developing immunity in the sector of Journalism. It is highly necessary to address the shortcomings and help raise the determination and assurance of the journalists and cause multidimensional progress of the sector of journalism. There is still need for Journalism in Nepal to struggle for their professional and physical security as well as to establish freedom of press and of expression.
