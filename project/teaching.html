        <h2>WHAT IS TEACHING ?</h2><br>
		<p>Teaching is the process of imparting knowledge, skills, and values to others. It involves 
            guiding and facilitating learning through instruction, demonstration, or discussion. 
            The goal is to help learners understand concepts and develop skills in various settings, 
            such as schools, online, or informal environments.</p><br><br><br>
			<h2>TEACHING IN NEPAL</h2><br>
			<p>In Nepal, there were around 1.4 million students enrolled in grade one in the year 2005. However, in 2015 only 400,000 students took the School Leaving Certificate (SLC) exams, with less than 200,000 students graduating with their SLC:  approximately 1 million students dropped out before Grade 10 and 1.2 million students did not graduate from secondary school.
            Almost two-thirds of students in Nepal attend public schools, with a significant number failing to graduate at the end of Grade 10 and almost 90% of those failing the SLC exams do so because of English or Science subjects. Public schools in Nepal do not have sufficient resources, both in terms of manpower and infrastructure, being unable to hire and retain teachers, nor ensure adequate training prior to hiring and ongoing training for their teachers. In remote areas where there are not many teachers, primary level teachers are often teaching secondary level students, all of which severely affects and compromises the standard of education in Nepal.</p>
			<br><br><br>
			<h2>GOAL OF TEACHING PROGRAMS</h2><br>
			<p>The main goals of teaching programs in Nepal are to enhance literacy and numeracy, promote quality education, preserve cultural heritage, develop practical skills, encourage critical thinking, ensure inclusive education, and raise environmental awareness.
                For Nepal to develop as a nation within the global economy, it is essential that the educational needs of children and the lack of breadth in the education system is addressed, to produce independent and self-reliant members of society.
