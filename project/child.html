        <h2>WHAT IS CHILDREN DEVELOPMENT ?</h2><br>
		<p>Children's development in Nepal involves ensuring their physical health and nutrition, access to quality education, protection of their rights, and support for their psychosocial well-being. It also includes promoting 
            participation in cultural and recreational activities and ensuring social inclusion and equity.
             Efforts focus on combating child labor, abuse, and exploitation, while addressing
              disparities and providing equal opportunities for all children. Despite challenges like poverty and
               geographic isolation, ongoing efforts aim to create a supportive environment for the overall
                growth and development of children in Nepal.
            </p><br><br><br>
			<h2>CHILDRENS DEVELOPMENT IN NEPAL</h2><br>
            <p>Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world, with approximately 25% of its population living below the poverty line. Therefore, the fundamental rights of many community children are often not met. Most children in rural communities aged 3 to 5 do not have quality education. About 5% of children never go to school.
                The children who go to school drop out of their school education before completing high school. Only 46.2% of children complete their high school education. They instead help at home, support household chores, and babysit while their parents work on the farm. 37.4% of children aged 5 to 17 are involved in employment labor, with a significant proportion working on their family farms. 26.3% of children aged 10 to 18 are married or in union with their partner. So The Childrenâ€™s development is not much in place.</p>

			<br><br><br>
			<h2>GOAL OF CHILDRENS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS</h2><br>
			<p>The main goal of children's development in Nepal is to ensure that every child can grow, learn, and thrive in a safe and supportive environment. This involves providing access to quality healthcare and education, protecting children's rights, promoting social equity and inclusion, and supporting their holistic physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development. Additionally, it includes empowering children to participate in decision-making processes and fostering an environment that nurtures their full potential.</p>
