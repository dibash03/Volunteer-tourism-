        <h2>WHAT IS WOMEN EMPOWERMENT ?</h2><br>
		<p>Women empowerment refers to the process of enabling women to have control over their lives, exercise their rights, and achieve their aspirations in various spheres of society. It involves promoting their capacity to make strategic life choices where they were previously denied the ability or opportunity to do so.
			Women Empowerment Program and gender issues are global issues, affecting countries across the world in a variety of ways. Unlike in more economically developed countries, women in Nepal have vastly different roles and opportunities in society compared to continents like Europe and North America. 
			For example, the majority of people in Nepal who cannot read or write are women, they have a much lower life expectancy than men and the majority of women rely on men who their basic needs of housing, food, and economic stability.</p><br><br><br>
