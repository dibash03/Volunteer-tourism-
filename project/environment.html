        <h2>WHAT IS ENVIRONMENT CONSERVATION ?</h2><br>
		<p>Environmental conservation is the practice of protecting and managing natural resources and ecosystems to maintain biodiversity, prevent degradation, and ensure sustainable use for future generations. It involves actions like preserving habitats, reducing pollution, managing waste, and addressing climate change to safeguard the environment and promote the health of the planet.</p><br><br><br>
			<h2>ENVIRONMENT CONSERVATION IN NEPAL</h2><br>
			<p>Nepal possesses a phenomenal landscape, from the flatland to the tallest mountains in the
            world.  Its diverse geography and climate support significant biodiversity and the 
            country is rich in natural resources, as well as having significant hydropower potential.
              However, while Nepal is largely dependent upon traditional and labor-intensive agricultural
               practices, soil remains subject to erosion, forests are destroyed and landslides pervade. 
                The current yield from traditional agricultural practices is not enough to feed the
                 growing population. Without intervention and positive leadership, Nepal’s 
                 people remain ignorant of environmental issues.Nepal’s water resources continue to be depleted. According to the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage in Nepal, even though 80% of the total population has access to drinking water, it is not safe for human consumption. Many rural people have to depend on small rivulets spending hours carrying water on their backs. Industry, agriculture, and an increasing population are all in competition for Nepal’s precious water resources.</p>

			<h2>GOAL OF ENVIRONMENT CONSERVATION PROGRAMS</h2><br>
			<p> The goal of the Environment Conservation Program is to conserve promote and protect the natural environment as well as the country’s historical & cultural heritage for future generations. The Program aims to achieve this by raising awareness of environmental issues in the rural, underprivileged communities of Nepal, and by promoting sustainable agricultural, forestry, water, and waste management practices
